# CoffeeMachine

Welcome to my first Python project: a fully functional Coffee Machine simulator! This project brings a virtual barista experience right to your terminal, capable of crafting delicious Latte, Espresso, and Cappuccino on demand.

Features
User Interaction: Insert coins to purchase your favorite coffee. The machine calculates the total amount, dispenses the coffee, and returns any change.
Inventory Management: Keeps track of ingredients (water, milk, coffee) and alerts the user if any ingredient is in short supply.
Reporting: Enter 'report' to see the current ingredient levels and the total money collected by the machine.
Power Control: Enter 'off' to switch off the machine.
Dive into the code and enjoy a virtual cup of coffee!
